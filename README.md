# GITC (Guy in the Chair)

Guy in the Chair is a multiplayer dungeon crawler game with a twist. One player gets the usual experience of walking through maze-like rooms collecting items and weapons while fighting deadly monsters. The other player, gets to be the guide(or guy in the chair). They get the bird's eye view of the map and help the adventurer to puzzle their way through the dungeon without getting killed or just taking a few wrong turns. This aspect of teamwork is what makes this game unique, both players need to be in perfect sync in order for the adventurer to get out alive!

The idea of making a multiplayer game using python sockets and pygame has intrigued me for some time now. This brain child is the result of me finally having the right idea which I felt could make a fun and unique game.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the game being played and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Development Environment

This game was developed in visual studio code in the python programming language. It also heavily uses the python socket and pygame libraries for networking and graphics.

# Future Work

* Add much more challenge to the game(faster pacing and puzzles)
* Enemy movement
* Fighting mechanics
* More levels/random level generation

# How to Play

After cloning the repository on both you and your friend's computers, you will need to follow these steps.

* Make Sure that pygame is installed. [Instructions](https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted)
* Have the first player open to the GITC folder and run this command: `Adventurer/main.py`
* The player can enter the pause menu by pressing esc, and then select start server
* Now the other player can open to the GITC folder and run this command: `Guide/main.py`
* Enjoy!
